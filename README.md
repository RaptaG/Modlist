### What type of mods are these?

The following mods are for Quality of Life improvements, tweaks to the vanilla game and new features, all friendly to vanilla Minecraft's behaviour. Also, all of the mods are client-side, meaning they will work everywhere, even on servers!


### Why isn't this list a modpack?

There are 2 reasons for that:

- I don't have the time to keep a modpack up-to-date with the latest mod versions

- These mods can't form a modpack by themselfes they way I want it to. [Fabulously Optimized](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/fabulously-optimized/) or (not suggested) [OptiFabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optifabric) with [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/downloads) are needed for performance and needed QoL improvements (except from the existing ones)

## Notes

- If one of these mods gets added in Fabulously Optimized, it'll be removed from this list.
