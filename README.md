# RaptaG's Modlist
RaptaG's amazing list of client-side QoL and not only Fabric (and Quilt probably) mods



## Why does this list even exist?

I made this list for 2 reasons:

* It was requested from two Discord users, for some in-game improvements
* I personally wanted to display in public my own pick of mods

## Fabric or Forge?

As you've noticed from the description, all the mods in this list are made for the Fabric modloader (Quilt untested). Some of these mods should also have Forge version, but I won't provide any Forge links.

## Will you ever make an alternative Forge list?

No, this won't happen and there's a reason for that. I quited Forge some months now for the following reasons:

* Fabric updates fast - on the same day as Minecraft itself, and so do many of its mods
* Fabric loads fast - roughly the same as vanilla Minecraft, unlike Forge that takes minutes to open
* Fabric is small - no huge libraries taking space on your computer, for most mods you only need the Fabric loader and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)
* Fabric is popular - there are [more than 200 pages of Fabric mods on Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods?filter-game-version=2020709689:7499) and [more than 60 pages on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mods?f=categories%3Afabric) (most overlap though)
* Fabric is supported - many mod developers support both Fabric and Forge nowadays, some even move to only Fabric now
* Fabric is compatible - many mod developers work together to keep their mods compatible with each other
* Fabric is easy - many launchers are supported, and the [installers are accessible right from the homepage](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)

## Are these mods heavy for a low-end computer?

I wouldn't say so, since I play Minecraft on a low-end GPU. But to be sure, I'd suggest the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/fabulously-optimized).

## What about launcher support?

All launchers should work with these mods, if they support Fabric.
